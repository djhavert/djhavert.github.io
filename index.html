      <p class="summary-block-left-p">
        My PhD research involves recording electrical signals from brain slices on a Multi-electrode array.
        The array we use has 512 electrodes, each recording voltage at a sample rate of 20,000 Hz.
        We record from a single slice for 3 hours, and while we eventually do a much more in depth analysis of the data, it is extrememly important to see details about the neural activity live during a recording.
        In order to see these details in a concise manner, I wrote a program in C++ that receives the data, runs analysis, and displays the live results of the analysis in multiple graphical windows.

            <li>Background squares correspond to the grid of all 512 electrodes.</li>
            <li>Any neuronal spikes that occur near an electrode will be detected in the analysis step and then displayed as a dot over the electrode it was found on.</li>
            <li>The size of the dot represents the amplitude of the spike detected, and hence the distance from the electrode. Larger dots represent spikes occuring very close to an electrode.</li>
            <li>This window is extremely useful in determining where a slice is most active, which in turn helps us decide which electrodes to observe in the oscilliscope window, and which electrodes would be the most effective sites for electrical stimulation.</li>

          <ul class = "feature-list-ul-2">
            <li>The data comes into the recording computer via a National Instruments chip. A server is created on this chip and the raw data is compressed and sent out via network in arbitrarily sized chunks. </li>
            <li>My program sets up both a client and server to communicate with the chip. The client receives and unpacks the data sent from the chip. The server sends commands like 'start' and 'stop' back to the chip.</li>
            <li>The electrode array is recording and sending raw data at a rate of 20 MB/s. This data needs to be parsed and analyzed in real time.</li>
            <li>All data received from the electrode array is placed in a data buffer that grows and shrinks as needed.</li>

            <li>If the raw voltage on any electrode passes below the calculated threshold for a length of time between 0.3 and 3 ms without coming back above the threshold, then the software registers that a spike has occured on that electrode.</li>
            <li>Resgistered spikes are saved and displayed on the Spike Summary window</li>

          <ul class = "feature-list-ul-2">
            <li>Stimulation on the electrode array is input through a precompiled binary file that includes all the stimulation instructions.</li>
            <li>The user has the option to feed the stimulation binary file into this software as well. The software will keep track of any spikes that occur in a given period after each stimulus.</li>
            <li>This is useful to see live feedback of the effects of stimulation. Frequently we run an 'electrode-scan' protocol, which gives several stim pulses on many channels, to determine which electrodes when stimulated consistently drive the network. </li>

    About Me
  </h1>

  <div class="summary-block-left">
    <div class="summary-block-left-writing">
      <p class="summary-block-left-p">
        My name is Danny. I am currently a PhD student studying the effects of stimulation on the cortical region of rat brain slices.
        Specifically, my research lies in exploring the efficacy of using a brain slice as a resoivor computer in pattern recognition tasks.
        I have great passion for both Science and Programming, and
        I especially enjoy writing software to assist in scientific analysis.
        

      </p>
      <p class="summary-block-left-p">
        My first programming class was Introduction to C, taken during the summer between my first 2 years as an undergrad.
        C is certaintly cumbersome, but I loved programming so much I took an Object Oriented Programming in C++ class a couple years later.
        That was when I knew I wanted to pursue a career in software one day. 
        I still had a passion in science though, so I decided to go for my PhD in Physics.
      <p class="summary-block-left-p">
        In grad school I never stopped programming. When I joined the lab, we were recording hundreds of gigabytes of data a day, but the analysis of that data took very long and was extremely cumbersome.
        I created a pipeline for the many different and complicated analysis tools we use, then wrote the necessary scripts to run this pipeline on the university supercomputers.
        Now everyone in the lab uses my pipeline and the time needed to run analysis on our data has been reduced from weeks to hours.
        I found myself loving the process of creating software tools for others to use. 
        I preferred programming over collecting and analyzing data or reading scientific papers.
